    <p><b>Re: Sales Assistant Vacancy (Vacancy Number 40568)</b></p>

    <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

    <p>I am writing to apply for the position of Sales Assistant at ABC Clothing Ltd, which was advertised on <br>

    <ul>

        <li>cash handling and sales ability</li>
        <li>motivation and dedication</li>
